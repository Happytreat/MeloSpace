This is my first post on my new personal website! As some of you 
might already know, I have created this website using Gatsby which 
is so awesome! 

Did you know that Gatsby uses GraphQL to query for data such as 
from your file system?

Learn more about Gatsby [here](https://gatsbyjs.org/).

I aim to post more about topics I feel passionate about - such as blockchain technology, web development 
and cryptography, or something I have learnt while building apps. I will try to upload a new article once 
every week/fortnight. :)
