Some of the ways I get to keep myself updated with the technology in the field is
through attending tech meetups and listening to podcasts. Here is a list of tech meetups I 
would recommend to any developer who lives in Singapore:

- Distributed App Development Club (DADC)
    * >>> The Decentralised Apps Development club is a small 
          group of people who meet regularly - think book club meets tech meetup. The goal is to collaboratively develop a DApp (decentralised app) together, learn a lot of new skills, and have fun in the process.
    * I have attended two sessions of DADC and like many other attendees, I found the
    sessions incredibly useful for gaining general knowledge of the blockchain sphere. One 
    interesting thing I have learnt from DADC is Hedera Hashgraph (which is NOT a blockchain!).
    * Check out DADC [here](https://dappsdev.org/) and join their [telegram group](https://t.me/dappsdevclub/) for notifications of future events! 
- talk.js
    * For JS developers, talk.js is one of the biggest monthly event held in Singapore. Their session
    starts off with pizza (and networking) and typically has 3-4 20 minutes talks. 
    * Sign up for their next Meetup [here](https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-JS/)!
 - React JS Meetup
     * Spearheaded by Facebook, React is one of the most popular front-end web framework today. Similar
     to talk.js,
     Singapore's biggest React Meetup holds monthly session which starts off with pizza 
     (and networking) and typically has 3-4 20 minutes talks. 
     * Sign up for their next Meetup [here](https://www.meetup.com/React-Singapore/)!   

*A general advice*: Do sign up for these meetups early! The available slots tend to decrease fast
as these monthly meetups are insanely popular.
